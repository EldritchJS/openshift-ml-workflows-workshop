# Machine learning workflows for application developers

You know OpenShift is a great platform for the applications you’re running today. Most of the applications you’ll be excited about tomorrow are intelligent applications, which collect data and rely on machine learning to support essential functionality. These capabilities often seem like magic to users, but the artificial intelligence techniques behind these features are more accessible than you might think. Any developer willing to adapt existing engineering practices to build and manage predictive models in addition to conventional software artifacts can build intelligent applications.
 
 This hands-on lab will introduce machine learning workflows, show how they integrate into application development workflows, and explain why OpenShift’s combination of enterprise Kubernetes with a great developer experience provides an unbeatable foundation for tomorrow’s intelligent applications. We’ll focus on the habits, processes, and workflows that will help you to get meaningful results from application intelligence and show why OpenShift is the best place for intelligent applications. You’ll leave having solved a real business problem interactively with powerful machine learning techniques and OpenShift.
